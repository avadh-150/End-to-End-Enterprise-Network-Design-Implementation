# End-to-End-Enterprise-Network-Design-Implementation
🚀 Completed an End-to-End Enterprise Network Design & Implementation Project

I recently built and tested a full multi-branch enterprise network in Cisco Packet Tracer, focusing on real-world technologies used in modern infrastructure. This wasn’t a basic VLAN lab — the goal was to integrate multiple production-grade features into one functional design.

🔧 Key Technologies Implemented:
🌐 OSPF (multi-area routing) for efficient, scalable inter-branch routing
🛡️ HSRP for gateway redundancy and high availability
🔀 SVIs & Inter-VLAN Routing across three VLANs (10/20/30)
🔒 Site-to-Site IPsec VPN between HQ and remote server branch
🔗 DTP & Trunking for dynamic switch port negotiations
🖥️ Main Server Branch Setup (HTTP + dual FTP servers)
📡 L3 Switch Multilayer Design to ensure fast internal routing

💡 Outcome:
 A fully functional enterprise topology supporting redundancy, secure communication across sites, and smooth inter-VLAN traffic — exactly how production environments operate. Every device, protocol, and link was configured, tested, and verified end-to-end.

This project sharpened my troubleshooting mindset, reinforced routing & security fundamentals, and pushed me to design networks that don’t just work — but work reliably.

🔗 Always open to feedback or collaboration on advanced networking & cybersecurity projects!
